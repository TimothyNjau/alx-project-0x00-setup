# alx-project-0x00-setup
This is a NextJs-based project which I'm currently working on as I study FrontEnd Development at ALX. This project is meant to teach me the fundamentals of building modern web applications using React, TypeScript, and Next.js. This application mimics core features of AirBnB's UI, including property listings with images, ratings, and interactive components, while emphasizing best practices in front-end development.
## Best Practices
1. Project Structure:
 - Components are organized in a dedicated components directory
 - TypeScript interfaces are centralized in an interfaces directory
 - Pages follow Next.js convention in the pages directory.  
2. Component Design:
 - Components are typed with TypeScript interfaces
 - Reusable components accept props for customization
 - Components are modular and focused on single responsibilities
3. Code Quality:
 - ESLint is configured for code consistency
 - TypeScript provides type safety
 - Arrow function syntax is used consistently
4. Styling:
 - Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling
 - Responsive design principles are applied
 - Consistent spacing and typography scales
5. Performance:
 - Next.js Image component is used for optimized images
 - Code splitting is handled automatically by Next.js
 - Only necessary dependencies are included
